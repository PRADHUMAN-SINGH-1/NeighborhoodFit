## 📊 Where did the data come from?

The data used in this app was **carefully created**, not randomly downloaded.

### 📥 Base Geo & Place Data
- 🛠️ Tool Used: **Overpass Turbo**
- 🗺️ Map Source: **OpenStreetMap**

Using Overpass queries, the following data was extracted:
- Neighborhood names
- Geographic coordinates
- Nearby metro stations
- Parks and schools
- Roads and points of interest

### 🧾 Dataset Enrichment
The raw data was then **manually processed and enriched** with:
- 🛡️ Relative safety scores  
- 💰 Rent level categories (based on market trends)  
- 🚇 Metro proximity labels  
- 🏷️ Lifestyle tags (walkability, family-friendliness, quiet areas)

📁 **Final Dataset:** `bengaluru_neighborhoods.csv`  
Stored on the backend server and served through an API.

## 🔐 How the Safety (Crime) Score was calculated

- Official ward-wise crime data is not fully public.
- A **proxy-based safety score** was created for **relative comparison only**.

### 🧩 Indicators Used
- 🏫 **Amenity Density:** Schools, parks, hospitals, shops  
- 🛣️ **Road Connectivity:** Road network density  
- 🏙️ **Public Activity:** Commercial places and transport stops  

### 🧮 Formula Used
Safety Score =  
(Amenity Density + Road Connectivity + Public Activity) / 3  

- All values were **min–max normalized (0–1)**
- Equal weights were used to avoid bias

### 📈 Interpretation
- Higher score → relatively safer neighborhood  
- Lower score → relatively less safe neighborhood  
- ⚠️ This is **not official crime data**

## 🎨 How Lifestyle Badges were calculated

Each neighborhood includes lifestyle tags such as:

- 🧑‍👩‍👧 **Family-Friendly**  
- 💼 **Working Professionals**  
- 🤫 **Quiet Neighborhoods**  
- 🚶 **Walkable & Connected**  

### 🏷️ Tag Logic
- **Family-Friendly:** High number of schools and parks  
- **Working Professionals:** Office and co-working density  
- **Quiet Neighborhoods:** Lower traffic and commercial activity  
- **Walkable & Connected:** Metro proximity, parks, road connectivity
